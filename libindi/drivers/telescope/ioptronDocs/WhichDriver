1. Very first version: GOTONOVA/GOTOSTAR command (GOTONOVA RS-232 COMMAND LANGUAGE)

This one works for all current iOptron SmartStar mount that uses 8402 or 8401 hand controller. The command is sent via USB port on a hand controller. The products include Cube, MiniTower and SmartStar PR EQ mount and GOTONOVA upgrade kit. No more bug fixing or upgrading.

2. RS232 for iEQ45 w/8406 HC only (iOptron iEQ45-8406 RS-232 COMMAND LANGUAGE)

This one only works for iEQ45 w/8406 hand controller. The control is via RS-232 port on a mount.

3. Current one for mount with 8407/8408 hand controller (iOptron Telescope RS-232 Command Language)

Most recent one. It has been used in iEQ45 w/8407HC, iEQ30, SmartEQ/SmartEQ Pro. The command is sent via serial port either on the mount (iEQ30/iEQ45) or hand controller (SmartEQ 8408 HC). This command set will be our current and future standard.
